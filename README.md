This repository serves to brag about kewl commit SHA-1 hashes.
The main focus lies the first seven digits - because they make up "short" commit ids.

Here are some kewl commit ids, ordered by keewlness:
- [`eeeeeee`](https://github.com/Leonetienne/neat-commit-id/commits/id-eeeeeee/)
- [`1234567`](https://github.com/Leonetienne/neat-commit-id/commits/id-1234567/)
- [`5666666`](https://github.com/Leonetienne/neat-commit-id/commits/id-5666666/)

Have fun.
